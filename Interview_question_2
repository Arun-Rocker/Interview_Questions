**Que: Lets suppose I am trying to terminate a namespace but it's unable to do it.
What would be reason for it and how you handle the things?**

Ans:

1. Even though I have deleted all resources still that namespace is not gets deleted and its in terminating state.
How to deal with it?

**Que: Let's suppose i spin up a new pod then it's going to CrashloopBackOff Error, what could be the reasons?**

Ans: A `CrashLoopBackOff` error means your pod starts but **crashes repeatedly**, and Kubernetes keeps restarting it (with increasing delays). Here are the most common causes and how to debug them:

**Possible Reasons:**

- **Application Error**: Bug in your code (e.g., unhandled exception).
- **Missing Configs**: Required environment variables, config files, or secrets not mounted.
- **Incorrect Command/Args**: Wrong entrypoint or arguments in the pod spec.
    
    **Resource Constraints (OOMKilled / CPU Throttling)**
    
    Possible Reasons:
    
    - Insufficient Memory (OOMKilled):
    
    ## **Liveness Probe Failures**
    
    ### **Possible Reasons:**
    
    - **Liveness Probe Too Strict**:
        - HTTP/TCP check fails (e.g., app takes too long to start).
        - Command probe (`exec`) exits with non-zero status.

**Que: How we can isolate that particular pod from others?**

Ans:To isolate a particular pod from other pods in your Kubernetes cluster, you have several options depending on your specific requirements:

```bash
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: isolate-pod
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-sensitive-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress: []
  egress: []
```

This policy blocks all incoming and outgoing traffic to pods with the label `app: my-sensitive-app`.

---

**Que: Lets suppose I want to configure if an application is failed then only pod gets restarted?
what are the steps to configure that one and there are multiple steps, but you can tell me atleast 1 or 2 ?**

Ans:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app-image
    livenessProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 8080
      initialDelaySeconds: 15
      periodSeconds: 10
      failureThreshold: 3
```

- Kubernetes will check the `/health` endpoint every 10 seconds
- After 3 consecutive failures, it will restart the pod
- The pod won't restart for infrastructure issues, only when your app fails to respond properly

1. I want to move container logs to a S3 bucket with out using any thrid party tools from a K8s environment.
How can I do this?
2. Let's suppose I have configured a container with a Request CPU is 1 and Limit CPU is 2.
If pod is consuming the 2 CPU then what will be issue like what will be the state of that pod?
How can we troubleshoot it and what are the steps we need to follow on that?
3. Lets suppose same scenario with the Memory Request is 1Gi and Limit is 2Gi,
then what will happen and what is the state?
4. Let suppose I have 10 pods in a node and one pod is assume more resources,
If you know the term file descriptor, it is utilizing more file descriptors than others and it effecting to other 9 pods ok?
So how will you handle that situation?

1. Lets suppose I have multiple nodes and but on one node has always having disk space issue it is not the logs.
It is related to k8s and docker then you will tackle the situation? What will be your toubleshooting steps?
2. Let suppose for one application I am receiving the 502 error? What could be error and what are the possibilities?
3. Did you take a part in upgrade avtivity on K8s like if your organization wanted to upgrade the k8s,
Did you take part in such kind of activity?
4. What are the Terraform Life Cycles?
5. How I can identify the changes from the previous one in terraform?
6. Lets suppose in terraform I need to use sensitive data like password or any token, API key?
What is the option in terraform?
7. I have two resources one ec2 and s3 bucket and I have a condition that ec2 should be created when s3 is
successfully created. How you will handle this?
8. I want to create a reusable terraform module, I can use it in multiple times and multiple environments.
How you can you use make this structure of this reusable module?
9. We are many members in team and everyone running terraform.
How will you make sure that my statefile is do not have any conflicts and it should be up to date.
How will you manage this?
10. I want to deploy an ec2 instance and it should be scalable, lets suppose I having mutiple requests
then it should auto scale like scale and scale down based the traffic, like how we can acheive that one?
11. Lets suppose I am storing data in S3 and wanted to replicated it ina different region,
So how can you use to do that?
22.What is RDS backup strategy, How you will do that?
12. Lets suppose I have two VPCs in two different regions and I wanted to enable communication in between those two.
How I can achieve that one?
13. Lets suppose I have one Image it has size of 1GB, like your manager asked you to reduce that size.
Then how you will do that?
14. By deafult if you run the docker run command it might be logged as a root user right?
My requirement is to restrict that user as normal user, how can you do this?
15. Do you know what port docker daemon is running?
16. I wanted to run a job in every 30sec, how would you do that one?
17. On AWS howmany years of experience you have, and K8s and Terraform?
18. I already deployed the application and i have modified the code and trying to redeploy that application?
But my changes are not reflecting, what could be the reasons for that?
19. How would you rate yourself out of 10 in K8s, AWS, Terraform and Docker?
